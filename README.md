#                 Requirement Analysis in Software Development      #

The aim for this project is to enforce the analysis and structure recquirements in software development. The learner will obtain a vast understanding in the booking management system as the process is the same as the real life scenerio.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. 
The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. 

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.

- Improved risk management and cost estimation.
   - It is process where the cost of the project.
- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved.
   - The pace of the project and visible results in the period of the development.
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling.
   - Team is orchastrating a long term goal on how to tackle the project


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering
   - Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
   - Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
   - Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation
   - Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
   - Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
   - Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation
   - Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
   - Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
   - User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.  

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
   - Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
   - Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
   - Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.

5. Requirement Validation
   - Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
   - Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
  

# Types of Requirements.
#

# Functional

Describes on  what the system should do.

 - Examples:
   - Property search.
   - User registration.
   - User authentication.
   - Booking system.
  
1. Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
2. Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
3. User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
4. Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
5. User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.


# Non-functional Requirements
 
Describes how the system should be perfoming.
 
 Examples: 
 - Reliability.
 - Performance.
 - Usability.
 - Scalability.
 - Security.


1. Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
2. Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
3. Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
4. Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
5. Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
