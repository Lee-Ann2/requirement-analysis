#                 Requirement Analysis in Software Development      #

The aim for this project is to enforce the analysis and structure recquirements in software development. The learner will obtain a vast understanding in the booking management system as the process is the same as the real life scenerio.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. 
The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. 

# Why is Requirement Analysis Importan?

Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.

- Improved risk management and cost estimation.
   - It is process where the cost of the project.
- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved.
   - The pace of the project and visible results in the period of the development.
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling.
   - Team is orchastrating a long term goal on how to tackle the project
